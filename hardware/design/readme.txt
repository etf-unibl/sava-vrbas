This folder shall contain VHDL design files. Design units can be further organized in subfolders, e.g.,
module_a, module_b, etc. (replace dummy folder names with actual names of the design units). The top level
design unit should instantiate all those design units within sava_top_level.vhd (most probably using structural
description).
